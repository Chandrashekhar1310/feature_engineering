    "Min-Max scaling, also known as normalization, is a data preprocessing technique used to rescale numerical features within a specific range. It transforms the values of the features to a common scale, typically between 0 and 1. Min-Max scaling is accomplished by subtracting the minimum value of the feature and then dividing it by the range of the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate its application:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset with a numerical feature \"Age\" that ranges from 20 to 60. We want to normalize this feature using Min-Max scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the minimum and maximum values of the feature:\n",
    "   - Minimum value (min_age) = 20\n",
    "   - Maximum value (max_age) = 60\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate the range of the feature:\n",
    "   - Range = max_age - min_age = 60 - 20 = 40\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Normalize the feature using the Min-Max scaling formula:\n",
    "   - For each data point x in the \"Age\" feature:\n",
    "     - Normalized value = (x - min_age) / range\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider an individual with an age of 30:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Normalized value = (30 - 20) / 40 = 0.25\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the age of 30 would be normalized to 0.25 using Min-Max scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying Min-Max scaling to numerical features, we ensure that all the features are transformed to the same scale, regardless of their original range. This can be useful in machine learning models that are sensitive to the scale of the input features, such as algorithms that rely on distance or magnitude calculations. Normalizing the data prevents features with larger values from dominating the model's learning process and helps in achieving better convergence and performance."
